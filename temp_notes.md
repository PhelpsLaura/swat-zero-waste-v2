## Notes on gems to include

##### Admin

+ [active admin](https://activeadmin.info/documentation.html)
  + seems simple
  + Much of the admin work should be done for us

##### email [?]
+ Do we need to do something with the email?
  + do we need to be sending automatic emails, to be sending people to a listserv, etc?
  + I assume any email lists will be handled by Swat, may have to look in to how to handle that?

+ also a contact form that sends them an email


##### calendar
+ [simple_calendar](https://github.com/excid3/simple_calendar)
+ posters for events (images)


##### Galleries
+ It'd be good to have separate galleries for (for example) different events
  + what about instagram?

## Problems with Windows / Mac
+ I mean I might just install linux?
+ we can also use Heroku as a mediator if necessary; all that's needed for that would be heroku installed, and git
+ may need to do both
